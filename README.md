# EnhancedGraphics

Adds DLSS support to Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader. Non-Nvidia users gain OptiScaler support.

## Why use?

1. Improved image quality compared to FSR, especially at lower render resolution.
2. Improved image stability (lack of shimmering) compared to FSR.
3. Less blurry/more detailed compared to FSR due to upscaling now happening before post processing.
4. Non-Nvidia users can hook OptiScaler into the DLSS input to use XeSS and more recent FSR than the game ships with.

## Installation

1. Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/BradyBrenot/RogueTrader_DLSS/releases/latest)
2. Run the game at least once.
3. Extract `EnhancedGraphics_Native.zip` to the game directory beside `WH40KRT.exe`
4. Extract `EnhancedGraphics.zip` to the Owlcat Mods directory (Win+R, `%userprofile%/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader/UnityModManager/`)
5. Get `nvngx_dlss.dll` (minimum 310.6.0) from somewhere, e.g. [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-dlss-dll/), and place it in the game directory
6. Non-Nvidia users: follow the **OptiScaler** instructions below
7. Start the game, and load a save file. In the mod menu (ctrl+f10 by default), open Enhanced Graphics, and set the Upscaler Type to `DlssUpscaler`. Select a preset or drag the slider to make a custom preset.

## OptiScaler (non-Nvidia users)
1. Get [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/releases)
2. Extract OptiScaler into the game directory
3. Run setup_windows.bat
4. Choose `OptiScaler.asi` as the filename
5. Choose AMD/Intel as the GPU type
6. Say 'Yes' when asked if you want to "... try to use DLSS inputs ..."
7. Run the game as explained above. You can tweak OptiScaler's settings in its control pantel (default: Insert); you still use the mod's configuration (above) to turn it on and control the scaling ratio

## Known Issues

1. [base game bug] Some minor ghosting behind cloth, as cloth isn't included in motion vectors.
2. [base game bug] Particles scale as the render resolution decreases.
